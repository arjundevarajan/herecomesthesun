For the past year, I have been doing a research project with the Energy Data Analytics Lab at Duke University. Our project is to identify solar panels in satellite orthoimagery using remote sensing techniques.

To get some practice with image processing and machine learning processes, our mentor, Dr. Kyle Bradbury, wrote a MATLAB script to train and test a solar panel detection algorithm on a set of 200+ images (some with solar panels, and some without), and assigned us the task of modifiyng it to achieve better results. 

The details of this competition can be found at: https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/here-comes-the-sun, where I managed to get 2nd place! 

Now we are using the knowledge we gained from this competition to work together to create a robust detection algorithm so that we may train it using a much larger ground-truth dataset of solar panels (over 19,000) we have created. 

NOTE: The template for this code was written by Dr. Kyle Bradbury, my research mentor. Only files with "Modified by Arjun Devarajan" in the header were affected by me.
